Suppose we wanted to create a new type to represent hands in blackjack. One thing we might want to do with this type is overload the comparison operators like `>` and `<=` so that we could use them to check whether one hand beats another. e.g. it'd be cool if we could do this:

```python
>>> hand1 = BlackjackHand(['K', 'A'])
>>> hand2 = BlackjackHand(['7', '10', 'A'])
>>> hand1 > hand2
True
```

Well, we're not going to do all that in this question (defining custom classes is a bit beyond the scope of these lessons), but the code we're asking you to write in the function below is very similar to what we'd have to write if we were defining our own `BlackjackHand` class. (We'd put it in the `__gt__` magic method to define our custom behaviour for `>`.)

Fill in the body of the `blackjack_hand_greater_than` function according to the docstring.

Solution:

def hand_total(hand):
    """Helper function to calculate the total points of a blackjack hand.
    """
    total = 0
    # Count the number of aces and deal with how to apply them at the end.
    aces = 0
    for card in hand:
        if card in ['J', 'Q', 'K']:
            total += 10
        elif card == 'A':
            aces += 1
        else:
            # Convert number cards (e.g. '7') to ints
            total += int(card)
    # At this point, total is the sum of this hand's cards *not counting aces*.

    # Add aces, counting them as 1 for now. This is the smallest total we can make from this hand
    total += aces
    # "Upgrade" aces from 1 to 11 as long as it helps us get closer to 21
    # without busting
    while total + 10 <= 21 and aces > 0:
        # Upgrade an ace from 1 to 11
        total += 10
        aces -= 1
    return total

def blackjack_hand_greater_than(hand_1, hand_2):
    total_1 = hand_total(hand_1)
    total_2 = hand_total(hand_2)
    return total_1 <= 21 and (total_1 > total_2 or total_2 > 21)
