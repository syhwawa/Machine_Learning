## Methods Used

Two most common types of recommender systems are **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**. 

* Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of usersâ€™ attitude to items, that is it uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items. 
* Content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.

## Collaborative Filtering

In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective). The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use. 

CF can be divided into **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Model-Based Collaborative filtering**. 

In this tutorial, we will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. 

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Collaborative Filtering
#### Advantages
- Takes other user's ratings into consideration
- Doesn't need to study or extract information from the recommended item
- Adapts to the user's interests which might change over time

#### Disadvantages
- Approximation function can be slow
- There might be a low of amount of users to approximate
- Privacy issues when trying to learn the user's preferences
